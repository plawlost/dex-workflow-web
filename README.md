# Dex Workflow

Dex Workflow is a web application designed to help you manage your conversations and interactions in a smart, organized way. It presents your recent activities in a timeline, making it easy to keep track of what's important.

## The Interface at a Glance

The first time you open Dex Workflow, you'll see a clean, modern dashboard. Here's a quick tour of the main components:

### Main View: The Timeline

The central part of the screen is your **Timeline**. This is where all your recent interactions—like calls, emails, and Slack messages—are displayed as cards. Each card gives you a quick summary of the interaction, including who it was with, when it happened, and the key points discussed.

You can:
- **Filter** your timeline to see only certain types of interactions (e.g., just emails).
- **Jump to a specific date** to review past conversations.
- **Click on any card** to see more details about the contact and your history with them.
- **Use keyboard shortcuts** to navigate your timeline and perform actions quickly.

### Navigation

- **Left Navigation Bar**: On the side, you'll find the main navigation bar. This lets you switch between different parts of the application:
  - **Timeline**: The main view with all your interactions.
  - **Tasks**: A place to manage your to-dos.
  - **Rules**: Where you can set up automation rules.
  - **Settings**: To configure your account and preferences.
  - **Help**: For support and documentation.

- **Top Bar**: At the top of the screen, you'll find:
  - A **global search bar** to quickly find anything you need.
  - Your **profile menu**, where you can access your settings or sign out.

### Mobile Experience

Dex Workflow is fully responsive. On mobile devices, the interface adapts to a smaller screen, with a tab bar at the bottom for easy navigation.
